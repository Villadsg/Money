# Funny Duration Analysis - Enhanced Earnings Reaction Tracker

## Overview

`funny_duration.py` is an enhanced version of `funny.py` that tracks how long anticipation and surprise patterns last throughout the trading day. Instead of just classifying events based on closing prices, it monitors price movements every N minutes to determine pattern persistence and evolution.

## Key Features

### 1. **Duration Tracking**
- Monitors earnings reaction patterns every 20 minutes (configurable)
- Tracks how long the initial pattern (anticipation/surprise) persists
- Records when patterns change during the trading day

### 2. **Pattern Evolution Analysis**
- **Primary Classification**: The longest-sustained pattern during the day
- **Final Classification**: The pattern at market close
- **Pattern Changes**: Number of times the classification changed during the day

### 3. **Enhanced Metrics**
- **Duration Hours/Minutes**: How long the primary pattern lasted
- **Event Strength Timeline**: Maximum volatility reached during the event
- **Pattern Consistency**: Whether the pattern remained stable or evolved

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage with 20-minute intervals
python3 funny_duration.py NVDA --days 180 --min-events 5 --check-interval 20

# Fine-grained analysis with 15-minute intervals
python3 funny_duration.py AAPL --days 365 --min-events 10 --check-interval 15

# Coarse analysis with 30-minute intervals  
python3 funny_duration.py TSLA --days 120 --min-events 3 --check-interval 30
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `ticker`: Stock symbol to analyze
- `--days`: Number of days to analyze (default: 365)
- `--min-events`: Number of earnings events to identify (default: 15)
- `--check-interval`: Minutes between pattern checks (default: 20)
- `--benchmark`: Benchmark ticker (default: SPY)

## Key Insights from NVDA Analysis

### Event Summary
- **3 major earnings events** analyzed over 180 days
- **Average pattern duration**: 2.67 hours
- **Pattern evolution rate**: 66.7% of events changed classification during the day

### Individual Events

#### 2025-01-27 (Major Earnings Event)
- **Gap**: -12.49% (negative gap)
- **Primary Pattern**: Negative Anticipated (2.5 hours)
- **Evolution**: Changed to Surprising Negative
- **Pattern Changes**: 5 times during the day
- **Insight**: Initial recovery attempt failed, became full selloff

#### 2025-01-28 (Recovery Day)
- **Gap**: +2.86% (positive gap)  
- **Primary Pattern**: Surprising Positive (2.5 hours)
- **Evolution**: Changed to Positive Anticipated
- **Pattern Changes**: 3 times during the day
- **Insight**: Strong opening momentum eventually stalled

#### 2025-02-27 (Stable Event)
- **Gap**: +2.83% (positive gap)
- **Primary Pattern**: Positive Anticipated (3.0 hours)
- **Evolution**: Remained Positive Anticipated
- **Pattern Changes**: Only 2 times during the day
- **Insight**: Most stable pattern, but still ended poorly

## Pattern Definitions

### During Trading Day Classification
1. **Negative Anticipated**: Stock gaps down but recovers intraday
2. **Surprising Negative**: Stock gaps down and continues falling
3. **Positive Anticipated**: Stock gaps up but declines intraday  
4. **Surprising Positive**: Stock gaps up and continues rising

### Key Differences from Traditional Analysis

| Aspect | Traditional (funny.py) | Duration Enhanced (funny_duration.py) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Time Scope** | Open vs Close only | Every 20 minutes throughout day |
| **Pattern Detection** | Single classification | Primary + evolution tracking |
| **Duration Info** | None | Hours/minutes of pattern persistence |
| **Pattern Changes** | Not tracked | Counts transitions during day |
| **Market Timing** | End-of-day only | Real-time pattern shifts |

## Practical Applications

### 1. **Trading Strategy Optimization**
- Identify optimal exit times for earnings plays
- Understand when patterns typically reverse
- Set stop-losses based on historical pattern durations

### 2. **Risk Management**
- Anticipate pattern changes before they happen
- Understand typical volatility windows
- Plan position sizing based on pattern stability

### 3. **Market Efficiency Analysis**
- Measure how quickly markets process earnings information
- Identify stocks with unstable vs stable reaction patterns
- Study institutional vs retail reaction timing

### 4. **Algorithmic Trading Signals**
- Use pattern duration as a confidence metric
- Trigger alerts when patterns change unexpectedly
- Backtest strategies based on pattern persistence

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Daily Data**: Polygon.io API for daily OHLCV
- **Intraday Data**: 1-minute bars for precise timing
- **Market Hours**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET analysis window

### Pattern Detection Algorithm
1. Identify earnings events using Volume Ã— Gap metric
2. Determine initial gap direction (positive/negative)
3. Check price movement every N minutes
4. Classify current pattern based on gap + movement
5. Track pattern changes and calculate durations
6. Determine primary (longest) pattern vs final pattern

### Performance Metrics
- **Pattern Persistence**: How long patterns last on average
- **Evolution Rate**: Percentage of events that change classification
- **Stability Score**: Number of pattern changes as instability measure
- **Strength Timeline**: Maximum volatility reached during event window

## Future Enhancements

1. **Volume Analysis**: Track volume patterns during events
2. **Sector Comparison**: Compare pattern durations across sectors
3. **Market Cap Effects**: Analyze how company size affects pattern stability
4. **Options Activity**: Incorporate options flow for pattern prediction
5. **News Sentiment**: Correlate news sentiment with pattern evolution
